# What exactly happens when you install ruby?

	When we install ruby, it gets stored in /usr/bin/env.
	When we create a ruby file in some folder other than /usr/bin/env, it cannot be run as the the execution file ruby is not available in this folder, it is in /usr/bin/env.
	Yet we do not necessarily need to store all the ruby files in /usr/bin/env. To run it from any folder, the path of the file should be given in .profile or .bashrc file. It is called as setting environment variable.
	.profile is executed autometically during the startup process and .bashrc is executed autometically every time terminal is opened.
	After setting a path in .bashrc it is required to restart the terminal so as to execute .bashrc file.
	Following this step every time any ruby file can be run from any folder.
