# COMPILER VS. INTERPRETER

## COMPILER

Converts high level language into machine language. 
It compiles the whole program at once and converts it into machine code which will further be run by computer.

## INTERPRETER

Converts high level language into machine language.
It converts the code into an intermediate code before converting it into the machine code. Each part of the code is interpreted and then executed separately in a sequence. When an error is found in a part of the code, it will stop the interpretation of the code without translating the next line of code. 

## DIFFERENCES

1. Compiler compiles the whole program in one go while Interpreter converts one line into an intermediate code and then compile it. This step is repeated until the whole file is compiled
2. Compiler works faster compared to Interpreter.
3. In compiler when running the program, only the executable version of the code is running, hence, program need not to be compiled every time it is to be run. An interpreter converts the code during run time, it converts the code 1 line at a time at the time that it is running, hence, every time higher level program is converted into lower language.
